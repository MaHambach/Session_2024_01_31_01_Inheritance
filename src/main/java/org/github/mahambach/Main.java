/*Create a new Java project and implement the following steps to practice inheritance and classes in Java.

Step 1: Create a base class "Vehicle" with properties like "Manufacturer", "Model", and "Year of Manufacture".
Step 2: Create a derived class "Car" that inherits from "Vehicle" and has additional properties like "Number of Doors".
Step 3: Implement a method in the "Vehicle" class that outputs information about the vehicle.
Step 4: Override the method from step 3 in the "Car" class to also output the number of doors.
Step 5: Create instances of the "Vehicle" and "Car" classes and call the methods to output the information.
